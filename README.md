# Cat-Jumping-Game

I attended a MeetUp on 12/14/23 on how to make a simple Dino Jumping Game (ex: like the one you see on Google when your internet is down).
The MeetUp was hosted by OneCodeCamp, who provided the code for the Dino Game.

I edited the code slightly and changed the images to make this a cat jumping game instead.
All images/2D Assests were obtained with proper licensing.
